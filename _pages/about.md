I am currently an assistant professor at [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/) and [HEC Montreal](http://www.hec.ca/). Prior to that, I was a Postdoc at University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University. I also worked at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) as an associate researcher between 2014-2016. 

<span style="color:red">New!!</span> I'm looking for students (Postdoc, Ph.D., MSc., and interns)!! Students who are interested in working with me please apply through [Mila admission](https://mila.quebec/en/admission/) or send me an email directly. 

<span style="color:red">What's New</span>
======
* <span style="color:red">New!!</span> Two papers on graph representation learning for drug discovery are accepted to ICLR'2020!!
* <span style="color:red">New!!</span> We released the [codes](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/pLogicNet) of the pLogicNet model in our NeurIPS'19 paper "Probabilistic Logic Neural Networks for Reasoning"
* <span style="color:red">New!!</span> We just released our GraphVite system, which is super effecient and only takes one minute to learn the node embeddings of a graph with one million nodes. It now supports three different tasks including node embeddings, knowledge graph embeddings, and graph&high-dimensional data visualization. For more information, check this [link](https://graphvite.io/)
* <span style="color:red">New!!</span> We just released a library of recommender systems with deep neural networks including session-based recommendation, feature-based recommendation, and social recommenddation. For more information, check this [link](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/RecommenderSystems)
* We just released the source codes of our RotatE model. The codes are available at [link](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding).
